              <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4'>1. Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Welcome to {appName} ("we," "our," or "us"), a Dharma learning
                app dedicated to sharing the words and teachings of Buddha. This
                Privacy Policy explains what information we handle when you use
                our website and mobile experience (the "Service").
              </p>
              <p>
                {appName} provides access to Buddhist teachings and related
                educational content. We designed the app to respect your
                privacy: we do not require you to create an account and we do
                not collect personal data for tracking or advertising.
              </p>

              <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4'>2. Summary: No Data Collected</h2>
              <p>
                We do not collect, sell, or share personal data. The app does
                not use analytics, advertising SDKs, or third‑party trackers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Preferences you set in the app (for example: theme, font size,
                favorites, and basic navigation history) are stored locally on
                your device via <code>localStorage</code> or offline cache.
                These preferences never leave your device unless you choose to
                share them.
